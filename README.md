# waylaunch

A minimal, fast, keyboard-first Wayland-native launcher. One keystroke opens a unified search bar that returns applications, files, calculator results, and custom commands together — grouped and ranked.

## Features

- **Unified Search** — no modes. Type once, get apps, files, folders, calculator results, and custom commands ranked together with a single Top Hit.
- **Frosted Glass** — client-side backdrop blur via `wlr-screencopy`. Captures the desktop, downsamples, and applies a separable box blur for a glassmorphism look. Works on any compositor.
- **Async File Search** — dedicated worker thread runs a native bounded filesystem walk with prefix/substring ranking, recency bonuses, and path-depth penalties. Results stream into the UI without blocking.
- **Content Search** — index-backed full-text search *inside* your documents (Spotlight's "find in contents"), served by the `waylaunchd` daemon. An inverted index (SQLite FTS5, BM25) over text, code, PDF, **Office/ODF spreadsheets & slides** (`.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx`/`.odt`/`.ods`/`.odp`), EPUB, and HTML; the launcher queries it read-only and shows a **CONTENTS** section with a highlighted snippet. Queries are O(index-lookup), not O(filesystem), and stay bounded even on ultra-common terms. Extracted text is stored zstd-compressed, extraction runs in a sandboxed subprocess, and the index self-heals on corruption or schema change. Kept fresh incrementally with inotify plus a periodic reconcile backstop for when watches are exhausted. Supports **`mdfind`-style filters** — `kind:pdf quarterly revenue`, `kind:spreadsheet`, `size:>1M`, `modified:<7d`. See [`docs/CONTENT_SEARCH.md`](docs/CONTENT_SEARCH.md).
- **App Switcher** — an Alt+Tab overlay grouping open windows by application (MRU-ordered) via `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management`. Launch it with `waylaunch --switch`: hold the modifier and tap Tab to cycle, release to confirm — or Enter/Space to confirm, ` / arrows to move, `q` to close an app, Esc to cancel. See [App switcher](#app-switcher-alttab) for the Hyprland binding.
- **Power Actions** — `waylaunch --power` opens a switcher-style HUD with Lock / Restart / Exit / Hibernate / Suspend / Shut Down. Destructive actions get a confirmation card; commands are configurable and run without a shell. See [Power actions](#power-actions).
- **Application Launcher** — scans `.desktop` files from XDG data directories, filters in-memory per keystroke.
- **Calculator** — built-in recursive-descent expression evaluator with trig, logs, and constants. A valid math expression becomes the Top Hit.
- **Custom Commands** — user-defined shell commands in the config file (Lock Screen, Sleep, etc.), matched by name.
- **Preview Pane** — two-column layout: results on the left, preview with details on the right. Right-click reveals files/apps in the file manager.
- **Spotlight history** — recent empty-query suggestions and activation-aware frecency ranking, persisted under `$XDG_STATE_HOME`.
- **TOML Configuration** — modern, human-readable format with sane defaults.
- **Config Save** — snapshot current config (including merged defaults) with `waylaunch --save [path]`.
- **Theming** — customizable Catppuccin-inspired dark palette, fonts (family, size, weight, style), and layout.
- **Clipboard Integration** — file paths copied as `text/uri-list` on open; paste into search with `Ctrl+V`.
- **Keyboard-First** — navigate with arrows, vim/emacs bindings, tab-complete app names.

## Dependencies

### Runtime
- `wayland-client` — Wayland protocol library
- `wayland-cursor` — Cursor handling
- `libxkbcommon` — Keyboard handling
- `cairo` — 2D graphics
- `pango` + `pangocairo` — Text rendering
- `fontconfig` — Font discovery
- `librsvg-2.0` — SVG icon rendering (PNG loading uses Cairo)
- `sqlite` (FTS5) — content-search index
- `zstd` (`libzstd`) — compresses extracted document text in the index
- `file`/`libmagic` — MIME detection for the content indexer (optional; falls back to extensions)

### Optional (for content extraction)
- `unzip` — Office/ODF/EPUB text (`.docx`/`.xlsx`/`.pptx`/`.odt`/`.ods`/`.odp`/`.epub` are ZIP containers; their XML parts are unzipped and stripped in-process — no heavy runtime needed)
- `poppler` (`pdftotext`) — PDF text
- `pandoc` — fallback for `.rtf` and any Office/ODF variant `unzip` can't read
- `odt2txt` — `.odt` fallback when pandoc is absent
- (plain text, code, Markdown, and HTML need no external tools)

### Build
- C++20 compiler (GCC 10+ or Clang 12+)
- CMake 3.20+
- pkg-config
- `wayland-scanner` + `wayland-protocols`

## Building

```bash
# Install dependencies (Arch Linux)
sudo pacman -S wayland wayland-protocols libxkbcommon cairo pango fontconfig \
               librsvg sqlite zstd file tomlplusplus

# Install optional content extractors
sudo pacman -S unzip poppler pandoc odt2txt

# Clone and build
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/waylaunch.git
cd waylaunch
cmake -B build
cmake --build build

# Install
sudo cmake --install build
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run with default config (~/.config/waylaunch/config.toml)
waylaunch

# Run with custom config
waylaunch -c /path/to/config.toml

# Prefill the search query
waylaunch -q "fire"

# Save current config (merged defaults + overrides) to a file
waylaunch --save [path]

# Open the app switcher (normally bound to Alt+Tab — see below).
# Aliases: --switcher, --command-tab (all three accept --reverse too).
waylaunch --switch

# Open the power-actions overlay (see below)
waylaunch --power

# Debug output to stderr
waylaunch --debug
```

### App switcher (Alt+Tab)

`waylaunch --switch` (aliases: `--switcher`, `--command-tab`) opens a
full-screen overlay that grabs the keyboard and
lists open windows grouped by application, most-recently-used first, with the
previous app preselected — so a quick Alt+Tab flips to the last window.

Bind it in Hyprland (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`):

```ini
# Alt+Tab → app switcher. Hold Alt and tap Tab to cycle; release Alt to confirm.
bind = ALT, Tab, exec, waylaunch --switch
# Optional: also open it going the other way (then Shift+Tab / ` cycles back).
bind = ALT SHIFT, Tab, exec, waylaunch --switch
```

How it works: the overlay maps as a `keyboard_interactivity: exclusive` layer
surface, so once it's up it owns the keyboard — subsequent Tab presses advance
the selection and the Alt release confirms and activates the chosen window.
Because Hyprland's keybind consumes each Tab before the surface sees it, a
repeated Alt+Tab re-runs `waylaunch --switch`, which signals the already-running
overlay to advance (single-instance via `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/waylaunch-switcher.lock`)
rather than stacking a new one. Inside the switcher: **Tab/→/`** next · **Shift+Tab/←**
previous · **release Alt / Enter / Space** confirm · **Esc** cancel · **q** close
the app · **h** minimize · **1–9** jump.

Requires a compositor that implements `wlr-foreign-toplevel-management` (Hyprland,
sway, and other wlroots-based compositors do).

**Cross-workspace:** activating a window is a standard `wlr-foreign-toplevel`
request; most compositors follow it to the window's workspace. On Hyprland,
waylaunch additionally resolves the selected window to its exact `address:0x...`
via `j/clients` and focuses that (`[app_switcher].hypr_address_focus`, on by
default) — exact string equality, so titles like `(17) WhatsApp - Helium` match
literally. (Hyprland `title:`/`class:` selectors are regexes: a title-based
`activate_command` silently misses such titles, so prefer the built-in follow.)
If your non-Hyprland compositor doesn't follow the request, set
`[app_switcher].activate_command` — it runs on confirm with the window exported
as `$WL_CLASS`/`$WL_TITLE`/`$WL_APP_ID`, e.g.
`hyprctl dispatch focuswindow class:"$WL_CLASS"`. See `config/waylaunch.toml`.

### Power actions

`waylaunch --power` opens a switcher-style frosted HUD with six power actions —
**Lock · Restart · Exit · Hibernate · Suspend · Shut Down** — as round icon
buttons with hand-drawn vector glyphs (crisp at any size, independent of the
icon theme) and the familiar selection pill. Keyboard-first but fully mouse-
driven too; one-shot: pick an action, it runs, the process exits.

Bind it in Hyprland (`~/.config/hypr/hyprland.conf`):

```ini
bind = SUPER SHIFT, Q, exec, waylaunch --power
```

Inside the overlay: **←/→/Tab/Shift+Tab** move · **Home/End** first/last ·
**1–6** jump · **Return/Space** select · **Esc** cancel. With the **mouse**,
hovering a card highlights it and a click selects-and-activates it in one
gesture; clicking off the HUD dismisses.

Destructive actions (everything but Lock) *replace* the picker with a
glassmorphic confirmation card — it stands alone rather than stacking over the
HUD, since committing to an action ends the picking. It carries a **countdown**:
a depleting ring around the action glyph and a counter in the confirm button
("Shut Down · 42"); when it reaches zero the action runs on its own
(`countdown_seconds`, 0 disables). **←/→/Tab** move focus between Cancel and
the confirm button, **Return/Space** press the focused one; with the mouse,
hover a button to focus it and click to press it. **Cancel and Esc (or a click
off the card) dismiss the whole overlay** — they don't drop you back on the
picker, so a change of mind is one keystroke, not two. The overlay tears down
its surface *before* the command runs, so it never lingers over a suspend or
shutdown.

Everything is configurable under `[power]` (see `config/waylaunch.toml`):
`enabled_actions` filters and orders the cards (`[]` disables the overlay),
`[power.commands]` overrides any command (argv-split, executed without a
shell), `[power.confirm_text]` localizes the confirmation phrases, and
`confirm_destructive = false` skips the dialog globally. Defaults use
`systemctl` for the power verbs and `loginctl lock-session` for Lock; at
action time the power verbs are normalized to whichever binary owns them on
your init system (`systemctl` on systemd, `loginctl` on elogind), and "Exit"
prefers `wayland-logout`, falling back to terminating your login session. A
failed command is reported on stderr instead of exiting silently. A second
`waylaunch --power` while one is showing is a no-op (single-instance via
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/waylaunch-power.lock`).

### Content search (the `waylaunchd` daemon)

Full-text search inside documents needs the indexing daemon running. It builds
and incrementally maintains the index; the launcher just queries it read-only,
so search stays instant and still works (filename-only) if the daemon is down.

```bash
# Start + enable at login (recommended)
systemctl --user enable --now waylaunchd

# ...or run it in the foreground
waylaunchd --config ~/.config/waylaunch/config.toml

# One-shot crawl (e.g. from cron) without staying resident
waylaunchd --once

# Inspect / control the running daemon
waylaunchctl status                 # index size, files, watches, reconcile state
waylaunchctl pause | resume         # suspend/resume indexing
waylaunchctl reindex                # rebuild the index from scratch
waylaunchctl reconcile              # re-scan roots to catch missed changes
waylaunchctl exclude ~/private      # stop indexing a path at runtime

# Query the index directly (read-only, like mdfind — works with the daemon down)
waylaunchctl search quarterly revenue
waylaunchctl search kind:pdf budget          # filter by kind + content
waylaunchctl search kind:spreadsheet         # browse a kind (no text term)
waylaunchctl search revenue modified:<7d     # content + recency
```

Queries accept `mdfind`-style predicates mixed with free text:
`kind:` (`pdf`/`image`/`audio`/`video`/`archive`/`doc`/`text`/`code`/`spreadsheet`/`presentation`),
`ext:xlsx`, `name:report`, `size:>1M` / `size:<500k`, and
`modified:<7d` / `modified:>2w` / `modified:today`.

Configure what gets indexed under `[content]` in the config (roots, excludes,
privacy paths, size caps, `prefix` vs `substring` matching, reconcile interval).
The daemon runs at idle CPU/IO priority with a bounded memory footprint and skips
a built-in privacy list (`~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, …) by default.

group_by_app   = true     # true: one entry per app
quick_actions  = true     # enable Q (quit app) and H (hide/minimize)
hypr_address_focus = true # Hyprland: follow to the window's workspace via its

# Optional: compositor-specific fallback for compositors that don't follow the
# standard wlr-foreign-toplevel activate request to the window's workspace.
# activate_command = 'hyprctl dispatch focuswindow class:"$WL_CLASS"'
# NOTE: Hyprland title:/class: selectors are regexes — never match on raw
# $WL_TITLE (titles like "(17) ..." won't match). The built-in
# hypr_address_focus above already handles Hyprland.
